# openquest

OpenQuest is an idea that came from a long wait between college classes, sitting in the library drinking coffee after all my coursework was done.

The basic premise was, what if you could create a light-weight configurable game engine that could be included into other open source projects or used to supplement some other application, like an IRL tabletop game. Basically a game rules engine a-la-carte.

I got carried away and tied the interface and ruleset I was using into the engine too closely, but future plans include properly decoupling those things and creating a generic API for events that can be used to create a kind of story graph. Porting this to TypeScript would also be a big plus.
